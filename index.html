            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              The central dogma of molecular biology
              <a href="#note1"><sup id="ref1">[1]</sup></a> states that genetic
              information moves only in one direction, from DNA to RNA to
              protein. However, in the 1970s the discovery of
              <strong>reverse transcription</strong>, which converts RNA to DNA,
              required the dogma to be restated as: once the biological
              information is translated into protein, it is not possible to go
              the other way.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Reverse transcriptase</strong> (RT), the enzyme that
              catalyses reverse transcription, has now been found in all
              branches of life: bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and viruses. HIV
              is one of the viruses that use RT as part of its strategy of
              replication.

              The Baltimore Classification
              <a href="#note2"><sup id="ref2">[2]</sup></a> of HIV is Group VI
              (+) ssRNA-RT.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The ' (+)' denotes that the RNA is positive sense, meaning
                  that it runs in the 5' to 3' direction.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Note that 'RT' here stands for 'retrovirus', i.e. a virus that
                  uses reverse transcription.

                  <span class="bold-special">1. Binding</span>. The viral spike
                  protein gp120 binds to the Helper T-cell's CD4 receptor. This
                  causes a conformational change in the CD4 receptor, binding
                  gp120 to the CCR5 co-receptor.

                  <span class="bold-special">2. Fusion</span>. The binding of
                  gp120 and CCR5 enables the stalk of the spike (gp41) to pierce
                  the T-cell's membrane. This pulls the virus and host membranes
                  together until the virus fuses with the host cell. The inner
                  contents of the virus are then released into the cell, and the
                  matrix and capsid proteins dissolve, releasing the viral RNA,
                  and the RT and integrase enzymes into the cytoplasm.

                  RT is an enzyme composed of distinct domains that exhibit
                  different biochemical activities. The predominant functions of
                  RT are RNA-dependent polymerase activity and RNase H activity.
                  However, as is the case with HIV, DNA-dependent DNA polymerase
                  activity is also a possibility. The process of reverse
                  transcription involves the following steps:

            <h2>The Target of HIV: the Helper T-cell</h2>
            <p>
              The virus mainly targets Helper T-cells
              <a href="#note6"><sup id="ref6">[6]</sup></a> (also known as
              Helper T lymphocytes or CD4+ cells). These cells are crucial for
              the functioning of the adaptive immune system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Helper T-cells do not attack pathogens directly. Instead, they:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>
                <p>
                  bind to T-lymphocytes, stimulating them to differentiate into
                  specialised T-cells, e.g. cytotoxic cells,
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  bind to B-lymphocytes, inducing differentiation into plasma
                  cells, and memory B cells (which produce and store antibodies)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  release chemicals (cytokines), stimulating defence responses
                  in macrophages, neutrophils, basophils and other cells.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Effect on the T-cell</h3>
            <p>
              If the viral DNA embedded in the T-cell genome remains
              inactivated, generations of mitosis will ensure that it is passed
              on to generations of daughter cells. Once the viral DNA is
              activated, large numbers of virions will be produced, and their
              continual budding will cause the cell to lyse (burst). Other
              factors contribute to the death of infected T-cells, e.g.
              apoptosis (programmed cell death) caused by the detection of the
              viral DNA by specialised host cell proteins.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result of the death of large numbers of T-cells will be the
              gradual degradation of the host organism's immune response. As
              this continues to weaken, the host organism will be rendered ever
              more vulnerable to a myriad of opportunistic infections which,
              without treatment, will lead to its death.

            <h2>AIDS</h2>
            <p>
              AIDS stands for Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome, the umbrella term
              for the multiple infections that take advantage of the breakdown
              of the immune system .
            </p>
            <p>
              While AIDS usually proved fatal in the past, in recent years many
              drugs have been developed to neutralise the various stages of
              viral infection. The activities of these drugs include :
            </p>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>
                <p>
                  causing conformational changes in the spike proteins,
                  disallowing the initial docking of the virion with the host
                  cell receptors,
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><p>inhibiting RT to stop reverse transcription,</p></li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  inhibiting integrase to stop transport and integration of the
                  viral DNA into the host genome, and
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><p>inhibiting the translation of viral DNA into mRNA.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A cocktail of these drugs is often required to successfully treat
              a sufferer, acting on the principle that if one fails, another
              will succeed.

                  categorised as single-stranded?</em
                >
                It is single-stranded in the sense that, as both strands are
                positive-sense, they do not complement each other.

                  >Why are there are two strands of viral RNA when only one

                </em>
                One strand is often sufficient for reverse transcription of
                complementary DNA. However, viral RNA is not as well formed as
                cell RNA and can have missing nucleotides. In this event, RT is
                able to switch from one viral RNA to the other transcribing
                sections of RNA from each and afterwards joining the transcribed
                segments into single strand of cDNA. For a more detailed
                discussion, see
